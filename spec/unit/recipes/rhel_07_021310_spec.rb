### A separate file system must be used for user home directories (such as /home or an equivalent). ###
# The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.

######
#
# Check:
#
# Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for non-privileged local interactive user home directories.# # Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users (those with a UID greater than 1000) on the system with the following command:# # #cut -d: -f 1,3,6,7 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{3}" | tr ":" "\t"# # adamsj /home/adamsj /bin/bash# jacksonm /home/jacksonm /bin/bash# smithj /home/smithj /bin/bash# # The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, /home) and usersâ€™ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.# # Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged interactive users with the following command:# # Note: The partition of /home is used in the example.# # # grep /home /etc/fstab# UUID=333ada18    /home                   ext4    noatime,nobarrier,nodev  1 2# # If a separate entry for the file system/partition that contains the non-privileged interactive users' home directories does not exist, this is a finding.#
#
######
#
# Fix:
#
# Migrate the "/home" directory onto a separate file system/partition.#
