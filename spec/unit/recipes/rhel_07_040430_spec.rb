### The SSH daemon must not permit Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI) authentication unless needed. ###
# GSSAPI authentication is used to provide additional authentication mechanisms to applications. Allowing GSSAPI authentication through SSH exposes the systemâ€™s GSSAPI to remote hosts, increasing the attack surface of the system. GSSAPI authentication must be disabled unless needed.

######
#
# Check:
#
# Verify the SSH daemon does not permit GSSAPI authentication unless approved.# # Check that the SSH daemon does not permit GSSAPI authentication with the following command:# # # grep -i gssapiauth /etc/ssh/sshd_config# GSSAPIAuthentication no# # If the "GSSAPIAuthentication" keyword is missing, is set to "yes" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), or the returned line is commented out, this is a finding.#
#
######
#
# Fix:
#
# Uncomment the "GSSAPIAuthentication" keyword in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor) and set the value to "no":# # GSSAPIAuthentication no# # The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect.# # If GSSAPI authentication is required, it must be documented, to include the location of the configuration file, with the ISSO.#
